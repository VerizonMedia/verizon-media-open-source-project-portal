# Project Portal Open Source 

This is a version of the [Inner Source Portal](https://github.com/SAP/project-portal-for-innersource) created to list all of VZ Media's Open Source Projects in one convenient location. 

We have removed the activity score completely, and rather than build a repos.json file, we ping the Github API on the fly to pull in all of our respository information. 

This way, to ensure a repo is included just means the org itself needs to be in our orgList variale. 


## Thirdparty

We use the following open source frameworks to create the portal:

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
* [Material-Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-icons)
* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
* [Seedrandom](https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom)
